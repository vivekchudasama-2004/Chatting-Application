# ANSWER: No Deployment Link Available

## Direct Response to: "give me a link that you deployed this project"

**There is no deployment link for this project because this is a desktop application, not a web application.**

### Why No Web Link Exists:

1. **Java Swing GUI Application**: Uses desktop windows, not web pages
2. **Local Socket Communication**: Communicates via TCP on localhost
3. **Requires Desktop Environment**: Needs Java and GUI support
4. **Not Web-Compatible**: Cannot run in web browsers

### What You Can Do Instead:

#### Option 1: Run Locally (Recommended)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vivekchudasama-2004/Chatting-Application.git
cd Chatting-Application
./build.sh
./run.sh server  # Terminal 1
./run.sh client  # Terminal 2
```

#### Option 2: Docker (Local)
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

#### Option 3: Create Your Own Web Version
If you need a web-deployable chat, you'll need to:
- Rewrite the frontend using HTML/JavaScript
- Create a web server backend
- Use WebSockets for real-time communication
- Deploy to platforms like Heroku, Vercel, or Netlify

**Bottom Line**: This project runs on your computer, not on the web. No URL exists because it's not designed for web deployment.
